# Invasive_Ductal_Carcinoma_Detection_Using_Convolutional_Neural_Networks
A web app that detects whether a image of breast cells contains IDC or not using CNN implemented with numpy

(This section is temporary and will be updated with each modification in the project.)
All the components of the custom built CNN have been implemented in numpy.
You can download the mainModel.py file and run it in console to see the output of the final softmax layer.
